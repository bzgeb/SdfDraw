# SDF-based Draw Tool 

A weird experimental drawing thing. Read the accompanying blog post [here](https://bronsonzgeb.com/index.php/2022/01/15/drawing-with-sdfs-in-unity/). You can also play with it [here](https://bzgeb.github.io/SdfDraw/). Just click to create new goop, hit spacebar to pause the animation. Note: It doesn't work well in Safari.
